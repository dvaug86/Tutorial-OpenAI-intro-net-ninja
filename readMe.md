I started a different tutorial for openAI however they didn't touch on putting api keys in a .env file.
I feel this is very important and I am very rusty doing that. I found this net ninja tutorial does do that so I want to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. 
I have completed a few other net ninja tutorials in the past and I really like his style. 

Here is the link to the first video of 9:

Things to remember: Just because you have a .env file doesn't mean it will be ignored. Remember you have to create a .gitignore file and have the .env file in there
